# repo-push-automate
This python script automates the process of pushing files into GitHub repo. It automatically perform all the terminal commands like branch, add, commit and push. It commits the changes with the default message of current date and time. 

##### Reason behind this idea
I almost solve coding questions everyday in various platforms. I will upload those questions into GitHub Repos everyday. Somedays I forget to add it to the repo and sometimes it too boring to write all the commands for each folder everyday so I made this which does this task for me
